# bringToFront
Gnome-Extension - bring programs to front and hide the notification

This extension brings windows which are "ready" directly to the front instead of triggering a toast/notification.

I used some old, non-maintained and outdated focus-extensions as an example.

## Example
For example if you are playing dota 2 and found a game you will jump into your ready screen instead of receiving a "dota 2 is ready" message.
